This script is a Windows fork of https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain 
Please read the original README before reading this one.

This script and the toolchain are not tested well, so consider using a better and more tested alternative - GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors toolchain available in both source and binaries. It can be downloaded here: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Also, you can download the pre-built binaries of SAT for Windows here: http://dl.bintray.com/content/clouded/Summon-ARM-Toolchain-for-Windows

Compilation of the Summon ARM Toolchain for Windows may be less painfull if it is done through cross-compilation by MinGW on Linux since it's a way to avoid a lot of msys problems such as freezes on parallel make jobs, heap problems and lack of tools.

Requirements (for Windows)

MinGW - tested version is x32-4.8.0-release-posix-sjlj-rev0 downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/host-windows/releases/4.8.0

MSYS - tested version 1.0.11 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS/Base/msys-core/msys-1.0.11/

GMP/MPFR/MPC - tested with gmp-5.1.1, mpfr-3.1.2, mpfr-2.4.1 built from source and with older binary versions downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/. If you want to use them you need dll and dev packages. Place dlls in mingw32\bin and unpack dev packages in mingw32\i686-w64-mingw32

Sources for binutils, gcc, newlib-nano (or newlib) and gdb. Download\clone\unpack\libraries\openocd have been removed from the script since msys is lacking a lot of tools and downloading and installing them would take the same time as to manually download and unpack needed sources. So simply download and unpack into the working directory (i.e. /c/dev): http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.23.1.tar.bz2 http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.8.0/gcc-4.8.0.tar.gz https://github.com/32bitmicro/newlib-nano-1.0/archive/master.zip http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.5.1.tar.bz2

After that you can navigate to your working folder in msys and run: sh summon-arm-toolchain-windows.sh

Possible problems and workarounds

In case make cannot find gmp\mprf\mpc or if you encounter an error that says "Cannot compute suffix" try these options: 
GCCFLAGS="${GCCFLAGS} --with-gmp=${MINGW_PATH} --with-mpfr=${MINGW_PATH} --with-mpc=${MINGW_PATH} --with-libiconv-prefix=${MINGW_PATH}"

You may also try to set paths to dynamic libraries: 
export LD_INCLUDE_PATH=$LD_INCLUDE_PATH:${MINGW_PATH}/include 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${MINGW_PATH}/lib

If you get "couldn't commit memory for cygwin heap" error you can try to: Simply re-run the script and since some of the things have been already built the process will require less memory. Disable all antivirus and firewall software. Disable\close\stop as much services and programs as possible. Download msys of another version. Rebase msys-1.0.dll \ rebase all.
