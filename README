To compile the arm toolchain for barebone arm devices:
* Edit the shellscript header to match your environment
* Run it
* Profit

Currently tested and know to work target platforms:
* STM32F10x (Olimex STM32-H103 eval board)

THE RESULTING TOOLCHAIN IS FOR BARE BONE ARM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE, NOT FOR USE
WITH GLIBC OR THE LINUX KERNEL SO DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ASK FOR THAT!
