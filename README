REMEMBER!
---------
THE RESULTING TOOLCHAIN IS FOR BARE BONE ARM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE. NOT FOR USE
WITH GLIBC OR THE LINUX KERNEL. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ASK FOR THAT!

To compile the ARM toolchain for barebone ARM devices:
------------------------------------------------------
* Edit the shell script to match your environment
* Run it
* Profit

Currently tested and known to work target platforms:
----------------------------------------------------
* STM32F10x (Olimex STM32-H103 eval board, Open-BLDC v0.1, v0.2, v0.3)

Currently tested and known to work host platforms:
--------------------------------------------------
* Linux 32bit and 64bit (Debian unstable)
* Mac OS X Snow Leopard with MacPorts

Notes for Mac OS X users:
-------------------------
You need to install gmp, mpfr, mpc and libiconv packages using MacPorts,
DarwinPorts or fink. GCC-4.5.1 requires them.

For xml support in gdb you may want to install expat too. And add the 
--with-expat parameter to GDB target.

Notes for Linux users:
----------------------
You need to install several packages on debian just run:

apt-get install flex bison libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev \
libmpc-dev autoconf texinfo build-essential

You may want to try running the following comand instead too:

apt-get build-dep gcc-4.5

For xml support in gdb you may want to install libexpat1 and libexpat1-dev 
too.
