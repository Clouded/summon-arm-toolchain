REMEMBER!
---------
THE RESULTING TOOLCHAIN IS FOR BARE BONE ARM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE. NOT FOR USE
WITH GLIBC OR THE LINUX KERNEL. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ASK FOR THAT!

To compile the arm toolchain for barebone arm devices:
------------------------------------------------------
* Edit the shellscript header to match your environment
* Run it
* Profit

Currently tested and known to work target platforms:
----------------------------------------------------
* STM32F10x (Olimex STM32-H103 eval board)

Currently tested and known to work host platforms:
--------------------------------------------------
* Linux 64bit (Debian Unstable)
* Mac OS X Leopard with MacPorts

Notes for Mac OS X users:
-------------------------
You need to install gmp, mpfr and libiconv packages using MacPorts, DarwinPorts
or fink. GCC-4.4.0 requires them.
